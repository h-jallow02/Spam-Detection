# Spam-Detection

Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and classification of SMS messages, aiming to differentiate between spam and ham messages. The study includes a comprehensive literature review of K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Naïve Bayes algorithms, with a particular emphasis on building and evaluating a Naïve Bayes classification model.
Objectives

1. Conduct a comprehensive literature review of KNN and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an SMS messages dataset.
3. Develop and evaluate a Naïve Bayes classification model for spam detection.
4. Optimize the Laplace smoothing parameter for the Naïve Bayes model.
5. Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA includes:
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Word clouds
3. Pie charts
4. Frequency tables
5. Bar graphs

These visualizations provide insights into the characteristics of the dataset.

Model Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
2. Kappa: Measures the agreement between predicted and observed categorizations.
3. McNemar’s Test P-Value: Evaluates the performance of the classifier.
4. Sensitivity: Measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
5. Specificity: Measures the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified.
6. Detection Rate: The rate at which spam messages are correctly identified.
